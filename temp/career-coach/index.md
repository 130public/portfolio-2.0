## Career Coach is a Microsoft Teams app for Education

### What is Career Coach?

Career Coach is a Microsoft Teams for Education app powered by LinkedIn that provides personalized guidance for higher education students to navigate their career journey. Career Coach offers educational institutions a unified career solution for students to discover their career path, grow real-world skills, and build their network all in one place. Here is a video introducing Career Coach.

### Who is Career Coach for?

Higher education institutions that need to drive employment outcomes that uniquely match the aspirations of each student. Career Coach is designed for higher education students who are at any stage of their education. It is especially useful when a student is pursuing a field of study that has options when it comes to choosing a specific career.

### Why Career Coach?

Unlike stand-alone labor market insights or skill-focused solutions, Career Coach is an integrated employability solution designed to help students discover their goals, interests, and skills using an AI-based skills identifier and LinkedIn integration that aligns a student’s comprehensive profile with job market trends.

With a personalized experience, students can get inspired by different career options, connect with alumni, peers, and faculty, and learn with courses from the higher education institution, LinkedIn Learning, and Microsoft. Higher education institutions will be able to gain insight into the skills and career goals students have, as well as job market trends to drive curriculum, programs, and services to support student success.

According to [EIU survey data](https://edudownloads.azureedge.net/msdownloads/EIU-Microsoft-Education-Bridging-the-Digital-Divide-2020.pdf) (2020), 46 percent of students report being extremely concerned about getting a job after graduation, and over half said they had lost confidence in the value of a university/college education.

A [recent survey of 2,200 teenagers](https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20200911084002889) showed that half were questioning the value of a traditional ­­four-year college experience and were open to alternative paths to careers.

### How does Career Coach leverage LinkedIn?

LinkedIn is the largest network of professionals in the world and a primary recruiting ground for companies with 14 million open jobs on the platform. The world’s largest professional network allows students and new graduates to: Connect to the professional world, stay informed through professional and industry news, get hired, and build their career.

Career Coach shows students different careers based on alumni insights from LinkedIn. By connecting the LinkedIn Page for the higher education institution to Career Coach, publicly visible alumni profiles are aggregated to power the Career and People pages.

Career Coach features a small subset of free LinkedIn Learning courses that offer specific career-related guidance and activities within the app.

With a separate LinkedIn Learning campus subscription, access to the full 16,000+ course library is seamlessly integrated into the app, which empowers students to build the skills they need to launch their career.
