Seminar: UNIV 200: Career Exploration & Professional Connection (1 credit)
The purpose of this course is to help students identify and explore meaningful careers through a process of self-discovery and guided conversations with our alumni speakers. Over the course of this seminar, we will assess ourselves to understand our values, strengths, skills, and interests, and we will also examine what it means and what it takes to launch and sustain a successful career. To aid us on this journey, we will leverage the technological power of Microsoft Career Coach as well as the lived experiences and perspectives of alumni in order to ultimately envision and chart our own career goals moving forward. The course will feature CEOs, philanthropists, community leaders and other alumni in a variety of fields.

Instructors: Joy K. Ward, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences and professor in the Department of Biology, and Drew Poppleton, director of Post-Graduate Planning and Experiential Education
